      <div class=about-spacing>
        <p class='text-main'>In early 2015 I discovered 3D modeling and from there I found Blender.<br>
          I immediately found the love for design and learned from the best like<br>
          Andrew Price, CG Geek, Gleb Alexandrov and many more. I can make<br>
          wallpapers, architecture, cities, future, and landscapes. My main focus is<br>
          photo realism and I strive for every render to be that way. One of my favorite <br>
          things about 3D modeling is that you can create anything. This is where my <br>
          mind expands and develops.</p>

        <p class='text-main'>I am the founder of Pygmy Studios and is a freelancing company.<br>
          We are willing to hire but you have to have the right skills. We are looking<br>
          for people with sculpting and rigging abillites. </p>

        <p class='text-main'>If you want work done by us, you contact us <a href='Portfoilo-contact.html'>here</a>. Prices are determind by<br>
          how long and complicated the artwork is. </p>
      </div>
      <!--  <p class='text-main'>I also enjoy codeing, mostly in HTML, Javascript, and Python<br>
          I love good looking and user intuitive websites. I learned HTML in 2013 and <br>
          have taking many courses through Khan Academy and Code School. </p>-->
